Developed a feature-rich e-commerce application using ASP.NET Core 8, adhering to the MVC architectural pattern to ensure high performance, scalability, and security. Designed an intuitive, user-friendly interface with seamless navigation, advanced search functionality, and an immersive product browsing experience.

Integrated Stripe Payment Gateway to enable secure and seamless online transactions, supporting multiple payment methods, including credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and recurring payments, while ensuring compliance with PCI DSS standards.

Implemented robust authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core Identity, incorporating role-based access control, secure password management, multi-factor authentication, and token-based security mechanisms to enhance system security.

The application supports both user-driven online orders and admin-processed local orders, allowing administrators to manage orders on behalf of local customers while ensuring real-time synchronization with the central database for operational efficiency

The application uses Docker to simplify development, testing, and deployment. A multi-stage Dockerfile is used to build and publish the ASP.NET Core 8 web application, creating a lightweight and secure production-ready image. Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container services, including the web application, SQL Server, Redis (optional), and RabbitMQ (optional). This setup ensures all components work together seamlessly within a consistent and isolated Docker environment.
